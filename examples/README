This directory contains some example code, demonstrating how to write GUPnP
services and control points.

- light-server.c

A virtual BinaryLight device implementing the SwitchPower service.  This is a
networked light switch which can be on or off.

- light-client.c

A control point which will find a SwitchPower service and either turn it on,
off, or toggle the setting.
